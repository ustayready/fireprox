## Overview ##
Being able to hide or continually rotate the source IP address when making web calls can be difficult or expensive. A number of tools have existed for some time but they were either limited with the number of IP addresses, were expensive, or required deployment of lots of VPS's. FireProx leverages the AWS API Gateway to create pass-through proxies that rotate the source IP address with every request! Use FireProx to create a proxy URL that points to a destination server and then make web requests to the proxy URL which returns the destination server response!

### Benefits ##

 * Rotates IP address with every request
 * Configure separate regions
 * All HTTP methods supported
 * All parameters and URI's are passed through
 * Create, delete, list, or update proxies
 * Spoof X-Forwarded-For source IP header by requesting with an X-My-X-Forwarded-For header


### Disclaimers ##
 * ~~Source IP address is passed to the destination in the X-Forwarded-For header by AWS~~
   * ~~($100 to the first person to figure out how to strip it in the AWS config before it reaches the destination LOL!)~~
   * Thanks to ![Fred Reimer](https://github.com/freimer) for the awesome X-Forwarded-For patch within 1 hour!
 * I am not responsible if you don't abide by the robots.txt :)
 * CloudFlare seems to sometimes detect X-Forwarded-For when blocking scrapers (**NEED TO TEST W/ NEW PATCH**)
 * Use of this tool on systems other than those that you own are likely to violate the [AWS Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and could potentially lead to termination or suspension of your AWS account. Further, even use of this tool on systems that you do own, or have explicit permission to perform penetration testing on, is subject to the AWS policy on [penetration testing](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/).

## Credit ##
After releasing FireProx publicly, I learned two others were already using the AWS API Gateway technique. Researching the chain of events and having some great conversations, I came to the realization that the only reason I even knew about it was because of these people. I thought it would be cool to give them a few shout-outs and credit, follow these people -- they are awesome.

Credit goes to [Ryan Hanson - @ryHanson](https://twitter.com/ryHanson) who is the first known source of the API Gateway technique

Shout-out to [Mike Hodges - @rmikehodges](https://twitter.com/rmikehodges) for making it public in ![hideNsneak](https://github.com/rmikehodges/hideNsneak) at BlackHat Arsenal 2018

Major shout-out, once again, to my good friend [Ralph May - @ralphte1](https://twitter.com/ralphte1) for introducing me to the technique awhile back.

## Basic Usage ##
##### Requires AWS access key and secret access key or aws cli configured
usage: **fire.py** [-h] [--access_key ACCESS_KEY]
               [--secret_access_key SECRET_ACCESS_KEY] [--region REGION]
               [--command COMMAND] [--api_id API_ID] [--url URL]

FireProx API Gateway Manager
```
usage: fire.py[-h] [--profile_name PROFILE_NAME] [--access_key ACCESS_KEY] [--secret_access_key SECRET_ACCESS_KEY] [--session_token SESSION_TOKEN]
               [--region REGION] [--command COMMAND] [--api_id API_ID] [--url URL]

FireProx API Gateway Manager

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile_name PROFILE_NAME
                        AWS Profile Name to store/retrieve credentials
  --access_key ACCESS_KEY
                        AWS Access Key
  --secret_access_key SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
                        AWS Secret Access Key
  --session_token SESSION_TOKEN
                        AWS Session Token
  --region REGION       AWS Regions (accepts single region, comma-separated list of regions or file containing regions)
  --command COMMAND     Commands: list, list_all, create, delete, prune, update
  --api_id API_ID       API ID
  --url URL             URL end-point
```

* Examples
	* examples/google.py: Use a FireProx proxy to scrape Google search.
	* examples/bing.py: Use a FireProx proxy to scrape Bing search.

### CLI Usage Examples

#### List all APIs from default regions using an AWS profile
```
fire.py --profile_name myprofile --command list_all
```
Example of output:
```
Listing API's from ap-south-1...
Listing API's from eu-north-1...
Listing API's from eu-west-3...
Listing API's from eu-west-2...
Listing API's from eu-west-1...
Listing API's from ap-northeast-3...
Listing API's from ap-northeast-2...
Listing API's from ap-northeast-1...
Listing API's from ca-central-1...
Listing API's from sa-east-1...
Listing API's from ap-southeast-1...
Listing API's from ap-southeast-2...
Listing API's from eu-central-1...
Listing API's from us-east-1...
Listing API's from us-east-2...
Listing API's from us-west-1...
Listing API's from us-west-2...
```

#### Remove ALL APIs from regions defined in a text file (one per line)
```
fire.py --command prune --region aws-regions.txt
```
A confirmation will be required before proceeding:
```
This will delete ALL APIs from region(s): ap-south-1,eu-north-1,eu-west-3,eu-west-2,eu-west-1,
ap-northeast-3,ap-northeast-2,ap-northeast-1,ca-central-1,sa-east-1,ap-southeast-1,
ap-southeast-2,eu-central-1,us-east-1,us-east-2,us-west-1,us-west-2. Proceed? [y/N]
```

#### Create a new API in a random region from a list of regions
```
fire.py --profile_name myprofile --command create --url https://example.com --region aws-regions.txt
```

## Installation ##
You can install and run with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox
$ cd fireprox
~/fireprox$ virtualenv -p python3 .
~/fireprox$ source bin/activate
(fireprox) ~/fireprox$ pip install -r requirements.txt
(fireprox) ~/fireprox$ python fire.py
```

Note that Python 3.6 is required.

Building a Docker image: (Currently does not work on Docker for Windows, possibly due to line endings in entrypoint.sh.)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox
$ cd fireprox
$ docker build -t fireprox .
$ docker run --rm -it fireprox -h
```
